Markdown + Ruby + libupskirt
============================

> Inspired by Rick Astley wearing a kilt

Upskirt is an implementation of John Gruber's Markdown markup
language. Upskirt is safe, fast and production ready.

Redcarpet is Upskirt with a touch of Ruby. It is mostly based on Ryan
Tomayko's RDiscount wrapper, and inspired by Rick Astley wearing a kilt.

Redcarpet is powered by a modified version of Upskirt, which has been
updated to pass the official Markdown test suite and now has support
for many additional features: autolinks, smartypants, safe filters,
and a long etcetera.

Redcarpet is a drop-in replacement for BlueCloth, RedCloth and RDiscount.
